       <p style=" font-size: 25px;"> The world is filled with such a wide variety of wonderful destinations and beautiful places to visit, it can be quite difficult to compile a list of the best ones. Thinking about a traveler who, for whatever reason, has never set foot outside his or her home town, where would be the first places they might visit?</p>

        <h3 style="text-align: center;font-size: 40px;"> <b> </b>so here is my three most places that you should visit</b> </h3>
    </div>


<div class="pic1"> 
    <h1 style="text-align: center; font-size:25px; background-color: #3333cc;"> 1. first place </h1>
        <img src="https://travel.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/c5a8f6d/2147483647/resize/445x280%5E%3E/crop/445x280/quality/85/?url=https://travel.usnews.com/images/gettyimages-532590277_2ZNe4ra.jpg" alt="place 1" style="height: 100%; width: 100%;" />
        <p style="text-align: center;font-size: 25px;">The City of Light draws millions of visitors every year with its unforgettable ambiance. Of course, the divine cuisine and vast art collections deserve some of the credit as well. The gentle River Seine rambles through the city, flanked by stately museums, centuries-old churches, and blocks of Rococo- and Neoclassic-design architecture, further enhanced by cascading trees and glowing streetlamps. Peppering the Seine's cobbled walks and graceful bridges are impossibly chic Parisians, probably on their way to the market, cafe or cinema. </p>

    <div class="pic2">
        <h1 style="text-align: center; font-size:25px; background-color: #3333cc;"> 2.second place </h1>
        <img src="https://travel.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/472cf27/2147483647/resize/445x280%5E%3E/crop/445x280/quality/85/?url=https://travel.usnews.com/images/borabora_445x280_dtTOVY1.jpg" alt="place 1" style="height: 100%; width: 100%;" />
        <p style="text-align: center;font-size: 25px;">The small island of Bora Bora (just about 6 miles long and a little more than 2 miles wide) overflows with beauty. A dormant volcano rises up at its center and fans out into lush jungle before spilling into an aquamarine lagoon. In fact, author James Michener, who wrote "Tales of the South Pacific," called Bora Bora "the most beautiful island in the world." The 18th-century British explorer James Cook even coined it as the "Pearl of the Pacific." The very definition of a tropical getaway, blissful Bora Bora abounds with luxurious resorts, sunny skies, warm waters and friendly locals.  </p>

    <div class="pic3">
        <h1 style="text-align: center;font-size: 25px; background-color: #3333cc;"> 3. third place </h1>
        <img src="https://travel.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/49f7191/2147483647/resize/445x280%5E%3E/crop/445x280/quality/85/?url=https://travel.usnews.com/images/main_getty_resized_445x280_b8LdAje.jpg" alt="place 1" style="height: 100%; width: 100%;" />
        <p style="text-align: center;font-size: 25px;">Named for the remnants of glaciers from the ice age, Glacier National Park is located on the border of Canada and the United States and is often called the "Crown of the Continent" since it sits at the headwaters of the streams that flow into the Pacific Ocean, the Gulf of Mexico and Hudson Bay. A favorite among hikers, the park features a variety of trails for all skill levels, ranging from the easy Trail of the Cedars to the challenging Grinnell Glacier. What's more, the park boasts more than 700 lakes, numerous waterfalls and two mountain ranges, spread across more than 1 million acres that shelter an array of wildlife.   </p>
